                <p style="font-size: 14;">  This Webpage helps to visualise two major industries in Australia, Mining and Retail trade industry. Mining belongs to the primary sector and Retail trade belongs to the Tertiary sector. We aim to visualise how these industries have performed over time and which industry is contributing more to the Australian economy. 
                    We would start with the Retail trade industry as we have more data available on that.

             <p style="text-align: justify;">The bar Graph above compares each state and allows us to visualise which states are rich in minerals where mining takes place and which states are more inclined towards earning revenue through the retail trade industry. An interesting fact to be noticed here is that Western Australia is the only state which earns more revenue from mining than the retail trade industry.
